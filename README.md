Image Classification of Dogs and Cats using CNN and Transfer Learning

# Custom Image Classification 🛰️

This project was developed during my internship at DRDO (Defense Electronics Research Laboratory).
It focuses on domain-specific image classification using CNNs and MobileNetV2 with transfer learning.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 📁 Project Structure
- `cnn_model.py` – CNN model built from scratch
- `mobilenet_transfer.py` – MobileNetV2 fine-tuned for classification
- `preprocessing.py` – Data cleaning, augmentation, and normalization logic
- `evaluate.py` – Evaluation functions including accuracy and confusion matrix
